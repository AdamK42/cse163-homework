1. a) I do think it's an effective visualization. It indicates that there isn't
        much difference between genders when it comes to high school
        completion, which is how I understood the intent of the graph to be.
   
   b) I chose a line plot with the colors distinguishing degree type. This is
        because the point is to see trends over time of numbers, which line plots
        are good for in terms of visualizing changes of value over some other number.
        I chose color to distinguish degree because their are only two degrees, so
        color is a perfectly acceptable method of encoding.

2. This data set ignores economic class which could be interesting to see as
    that my show something interesting about what the degree completed was based on
    financial situation.

3. This data set is very small, so depending on the data that was used to test the
    model the mean squared error was over 10% different from test to test. Claiming
    any confidence in the accuracy of this model would be highly disingenuous.
